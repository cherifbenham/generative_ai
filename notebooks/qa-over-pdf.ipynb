Steering can be achieved at portfolio level, either by accompanying existing \\ncounterparties to align their  activities, or by adjusting the customer base.  \\nSource: 2° Investing Initiative (2020)  \\nDespite the relatively nascent status of this field , various approaches are being developed to \\ndefine and set the underlying science -based portfolio targets. In particular, a trend towards using \\nsector -specific approaches such as the Sectoral Decarbonisation Approach148 can be observed . \\nThese approaches  rely on the development and use of emission -based physical intensity metrics , \\nnamely energy or carbon intensity metrics that use a physical unit denominator and are \\napplicable to a specific sector (e.g. kgCO2/MWh  for the power sector and MWh/m2 for real \\nestate).149 ln addition, efforts are being undertaken to develop disclosure metrics that indicate the \\nimp lied temperature rise (ITR), which attempts to estimate the global temperature rise associated \\nwith the emissions of (a portfolio of) companies.150 However, as stated by respondents, such ITR \\nmetrics are still subject to significant challenges, such as a la ck of robustness or consensus in \\nterms of methodology, as well as coverage limitations.  \\nCivil society organisations highlighted the importance of setting sector -specific targets as it \\nwould be misleading to set an overall target on carbon emissions for the  entire portfolio. For \\nexample, overweighting healthcare in the portfolio can improve the overall carbon physical \\nintensity figure; however, it does not help to reduce emissions in the real economy. Instead, civil \\nsociety organisations advocate methodologi es that assess the degree of portfolio alignment with \\na given climate scenario to establish a forward -looking view. While the scope of portfolios \\nmeasured should be broad, outcomes should remain at sectoral level and not be aggregated. \\nAdditional examples of methodologies developed by industrial bodies for setting targets aiming \\nat assessing a portfolio’s alignment with low -carbon trajectories are summarised in  Table 6. \\nTable 6: Various approaches for measuring Paris Alignment151 \\nMethodology  Approach  Metrics  \\nSector \\nDecarbonization \\nApproach (SDA)  • Approach developed by SBTi for brown sectors such \\nas energy/power  \\n• Sector -level carbon emissions allocation approach \\nbased on production intensity  • Depending on \\nsector, e.g., \\nkgCO2/ kWh  \\nGHG Emissions \\nper unit of Value \\nAdded (GEVA)  • Approach developed by SBTi for ‘non -brown’ sectors \\n(e.g. IT)  \\n• A carbon budget is equated to global GDP and a \\ncompany’s share of emissions is determined by its \\ngross profit  • kgCO2/ gross \\nvalue -added  \\nAbsolute \\nEmissions  • Approach developed by SBTi  \\n• The percent reduction in absolute emissions \\nrequired by a given scenario is applied to all \\ncompanies equally  • Absolute kgCO2 \\nemissions  \\n \\n \\n148 Science Based Targets Initiative (2015).
